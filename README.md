# QESolver
A GUI Quadratic Equation Solver

# What is this and how to use it
This is my school project of a Quadratic Equation Solver, which has a pretty user-friendly GUI.

It doesn't do anything much, but yeah it solves your quadratic equation, if you find it hard to solveðŸ˜…

To clone this repo to your machine, use this:

``git clone ``

To run the script

``python3 QESolverGUI.py``

You don't have to install any extra lib to run this script.

This is just a **basic** program using Python, with **tkinter** GUI lib.

Anyways, EnjoyðŸ¥°
